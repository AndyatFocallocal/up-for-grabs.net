**Intro**

This is an opensource project which brings people and communities together to take action on causes they care about, both in-person locally and also globally. Locally the platform collects and rates the most effective ways people can take action on that cause. Globally it allows users to discuss, vote on, and then use their skills to build projects together which target positive action on that issue. 

The project also rewards users with a blockchain token to incentivise and reward action which benefits the each platforms mission, or the health and growth of the community built on it. 


**Main causes and branches**

- Testing : **Master**
- Peace and Well-being (Meta): **deploy-phm** 
- Homelessness : **deploy-btm**
- Climate : **coming soon**
- Public Art : **coming soon**

The codebase for all projects is identical as its purpose is the same, to unite people to take action on a cause they care about. All differences are coded in a language app (i18n) which loads them for each different site.
